# Earthquake visualization using Leaflet

This is visualization of the earthquake data from United States Geological Survey, or USGS.
The task is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
